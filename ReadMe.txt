This App download a text file from link: "http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~coms6998-8/assignments/homework2/contacts/contacts.txt" and then it saves the data in the contacts location of the SmartPhone. Now if the contacts are already present then it will not overwrite them,it will add a new one, so every time before running the app, make sure you delete the same previous contacts. Next, on clicking the GO to Maps button, a MAP will be opened. If you did not clear the earlier contacts, it will be very difficult for the MAP to fetch the contacts.
The MAP activity fetches the data from the contacts of android phone by querying the contact with the name of the Person. The name of the persons are passes via Intent from initial activity to MAP activity.
